# Drones Fruit Counting

## Overview

This project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for fruit counting using drone imagery. The goal is to accurately detect and count fruits in images captured by drones, providing insights for agricultural applications.

## Features

- **YOLO Object Detection**: Implements YOLO for real-time object detection.
- **Fruit Counting**: Counts fruits in images using the trained YOLO model.
- **Drone Integration**: Processes images captured by drones for fruit detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `matplotlib`
- YOLO model weights (pre-trained or custom-trained)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mramirezz/Drones_Fruit_Counting.git
   cd Drones_Fruit_Counting
